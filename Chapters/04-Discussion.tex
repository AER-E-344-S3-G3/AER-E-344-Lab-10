\chapter{Discussion}
\label{cp:discussion}

Questions need to be answered:

\begin{itemize}
  \item What can you say about the predicted pressures in comparison to the measured pressures? That is, does the theory under or over‚Äêpredict the wall pressure?
  The theoretical pressures under-predict the measured static pressures and total pressures for the 1st and 2nd Critical Condition; however, the measured total pressure was much lower than the predicted theoretical value for the 3rd Critical Condition.
  \item Give some possible reasons for the differences.
  \item What might this mean for the prediction of other flow quantities such as Mach number, temperature, etc.?
  \item Point out any interesting anomalies you might see in the measured data.
  \item Present your results in formal report format.
\end{itemize}
