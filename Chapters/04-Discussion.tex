\label{cp:discussion}

Questions need to be answered:

\begin{itemize}
  \item What can you say about the predicted pressures in comparison to the measured pressures?
  \item That is, does the theory under or over‚Äêpredict the wall pressure?
  \item Give some possible reasons for the differences.
  \item What might this mean for the prediction of other flow quantities such as Mach number, temperature, etc.?
  \item Point out any interesting anomalies you might see in the measured data.
  \item Present your results in formal report format.
\end{itemize}
