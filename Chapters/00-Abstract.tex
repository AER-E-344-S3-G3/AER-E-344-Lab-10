    Efficient propulsion design relies on understanding supersonic flow within nozzles, often predicted by simplified one-dimensional (1D) theories that estimate performance factors like form drag through assumed flow dynamics. However, the reliability of these predictions hinges on the accuracy of the assumptions made. This experiment tests these assumptions by measuring wall pressures in a de Laval nozzle under various flow conditions, including Under-expanded, Over-expanded, and Normal shock states, identified using Schlieren imaging. By correlating these real-world measurements with theoretical equations, this experiment bridges the gap between theory and practice, enhancing the predictive reliability of these simplified flow theories.
