To analyze the effects of a converging-diverging nozzle in supersonic conditions, we measured the static pressure of the nozzle and used the Schlieren technique to identify data at six different flow states. By using assumptions about de Laval nozzles, the static pressure data was used to find the Mach number and total pressure across the nozzle. Using the known cross-sectional area at any point on the nozzle and its ratio to the throat area, the theoretical mach number and pressure distribution were found and compared with the measured data.
